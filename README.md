## Background
This **ROSE-AP** is an IoT application for defining, building, and managing robot programs.
The **use case description** exposed below better conveys an idea of the **ROSE-AP** main features.

### Use case description
1. Using a cad designer a **program_definition** is generated. This **program_definition** is a JSON document that describes a robot program defining a series of trajectories that the robot is going to follow using a specific tool and velocity.
2. The **lamination_definition** is sent to the **Management System**.
3. Using the robot **program manager front-end** we select a **program_defintion** to generate a robot program executable for a particular robot model.
4. The **robot_program generated** is downloaded to a particular robot on the factory floor.
5. The robot engineer checks that the **robot_program** generated works correctly. 
6. If the robot engineer edits the program the **program manager front-end** is used to upload the edited program to the **Management System**.
7. Once the **robot_program** has been verified the robot engineer changes the state of the **robot_program** to verified using the **program manager front-end**.


## Install

Information about how to install the IoT **Robot Program Manager** can be found at the corresponding section of the
[Installation Guide](docs/InstallationGuide.md). 

Please visit the [step-by-step guide](docs/stepbystepguide.md) to setup a demonstration.

## Architecture

A description of the architecture can be found in the [Architecture documentation](docs/architecture.md)

## Usage

Information about how to use the ROSE-APP can be found in [User & Programmers Manual](docs/usermanual.md).
